This tool helps maintainers observe all forks of a given repository.
It finds branches that could be sent upstream by their authors,
but weren't (for whatever reason).
Thus, _poPR_ helps to review forked code, in order to merge or cherry-pick it.

## Install & use

```bash
git clone https://github.com/katrinleinweber/poPR
cd poPR 
python3 main.py --origin=namespace/repo
```

The script will find all branches in all forks and prompt you to open GitHub's
own comparison page to review the changes with the option to start a PR.
This approach aims to keep code complexity and the number of API requests low.

To analyse repositories with many forks faster, create a [Personal Access Token][PAT]
with at least the `public_repo` scope and and pass it with the `--PAT=` option.
However, this should only rarely be necessary, because unlike other tools,
_poPR_ waits at each potential PR for your review.
Thus, it won't burn its GitHub API allowance as quickly as other tools.
